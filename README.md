# Utah Amateur Radio Repeater Map

## Known Issues
- The links for the repeaters use an index number such as https://utahvhfs.org/cgi-bin/rptdtl.pl?Nr=187 where 187 is the index number. Unfortunately, with time, the indexes change getting out of sync causing the links to point to the page for the wrong repeater. If each repeater had it's own unique ID that didn't change, it would solve this problem.
